# Fill in Multiple Blanks Question

Given the following class definitions:

```java
public class Wiper {
    private boolean on;

    public boolean isOn() {
        return on;
    }

    public void setOn(boolean on) {
        this.on = on;
    }
    
}
```

```java
public class Minivan {

  private Wiper wiper;

  public void driveThroughRain() {
    
  }
}
```

The `driveThroughRain()` method should turn the wiper on.

What is the correct method call to do this?
