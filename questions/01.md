# Multiple Choice Question

What should we strive for when writing classes:

## Correct

High Cohesion and Low Coupling

> Correct!
> High Cohesion means the members within a class are closely related.
> Low Coupling means two classes are not closely connected or dependent on each other, which makes
> maintenance easier if one class needs to change.

## Incorrect

High Cohesion and High Coupling

> Incorrect. The correct answer is: High Cohesion and High Coupling.
> Low Cohesion means the members of a class are not closely related, so it might be that the class is doing too many unrelated things.
> High Cohesion means the members within a class are closely related.
> Low Coupling means two classes are not closely connected or dependent on each other, which makes
> maintenance easier if one class needs to change.
> High Coupling on the other hand means two classes are closely connected or dependent, making it more difficult to support change.
